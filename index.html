            his debut novel Nondito Noroke published in 1972. He wrote over 200
            fiction and non-fiction books, many of which were bestsellers in
            Bangladesh. His books were the top sellers at the Ekushey Book Fair
            during the 1990s and 2000s. He was one of the most famous and
            popular authors, dramatists, and filmmakers in post-independence
            Bangladesh since its independence. Dawn referred to him as the
            cultural legend of Bangladesh. In the early 1990s, Ahmed emerged as

            on his novels. He received six Bangladesh National Film Awards in
